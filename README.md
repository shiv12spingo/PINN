This repository contains the codes and presentations of my research on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a Inter-Disciplinary Dual Degree Programme (IDDDP) student at the Centre for Machine Intelligence & Data Science (C-MInDS), IIT Bombay. I worked in the Solidification and CoDeS (Computational and Data-enabled Simulations) Lab investigating how to solve complex problems using the framework of PINN and documented my study in the form of a thesis and presented to a panel of professors.
<li>Want to know how to solve a simple ODE using a neural network? Check out the ODE_NN.ipynb notebook</li>
<li>PINN is used to solve the nonlinear PDE of Burgers Equation in BE_PINN_Modified.ipynb notebook replicating a prior research with the addition of regularization, tuning, validation and a CPU vs GPU computation time comparison</li>
<li>Head to LCD_PINN_Tuned.ipynb notebook to see how to tune the hyperparamters of PINN using the bayesian optimisation technique for solving the Linear Convection Diffusion PDE </li>
<li>The hyperparameter-tuned PINN is compared with the analytical and numerical methods for solving the LCD equation in LCD_HTPINN+Anal+Numer.ipynb notebook</li>
